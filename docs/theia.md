# Integrating Yukibana into Theia, or any frontend

What a student's IDE needs from Yukibana is four things: who the student is,
which exercises are open to them, what a submission from their folder would
hold, and a way to send it. All four are in `@yukibana/cli`'s library
(`cli/src/library.ts`), which has no dependencies and runs wherever Node 22.15
or later does: a Theia backend, an Electron main process, a VS Code
extension host. `demo/electron` is a complete, small client built on it;
read it next to this page.

## What the library is, and is not

The library is headless. It owns the protocol (login, refresh, the API), the
data (the registry's answers, decoded and checked), the disk (reading a
folder into a bundle, unpacking a starter safely) and the network, and
nothing a person sees. Opening a browser, the page the browser shows after a
login, every list, button and sentence on a screen: those belong to the host.
Where a person must see something, the library takes a callback (`open`,
`callbackPage`) or returns data for the host to render (`bundle.files`,
`bundle.problems`, `RegistryError.status`). The CLI's choices are in
`cli/src/commands/`, the demo's in `demo/electron/src/`; neither is exported.

## The split

```
 frontend (browser / renderer)          backend (Node)                       registry
 ────────────────────────────          ─────────────────────────────         ──────────────────
 exercise list, preview, buttons  ⇄    YukibanaClient, SessionStore,    ⇄    /api/... as the student
 never sees a token or the disk         SubmissionBundle, login              (policies decide)
```

The frontend is a web page and is treated as one. The session, the client
and every bundle live in the backend; the frontend asks for lists and
verdicts over whatever RPC the host has (Theia's JSON-RPC service, Electron's
IPC). In Theia that is a backend contribution exposing a service, and a
frontend widget calling it. `demo/electron/src/bridge.ts` is that service's
interface, and is a reasonable starting point for the Theia one.

## Logging in

A login is three steps so the host decides how the browser is shown and where
it comes back:

```ts
import { startLogin, loginWithLoopback } from '@yukibana/cli';

// Desktop (Electron Theia): back to a listener on 127.0.0.1 on a free port.
// The host opens the address and writes the page the browser lands on.
const session = await loginWithLoopback(registry, {
  open: (url) => openExternal(url),
  callbackPage: (outcome) => outcome.ok ? signedInPage() : failedPage(escapeHtml(outcome.reason)),
});

// Browser Theia, served from elsewhere: back to a route the Theia server owns.
const pending = await startLogin(registry, 'https://ide.example.org/yukibana/callback');
openInNewTab(pending.authorizeUrl);
// …the route receives the browser and hands its URL to the backend:
const session2 = await pending.finish(callbackUrl);
```

It is OAuth with PKCE against the registry's Supabase Auth, with GitHub as
the provider, the same identity as the website. The code the browser carries
is useless without a verifier that never leaves the backend.

The redirect must be on the Auth server's allow list (`supabase/config.toml`,
`additional_redirect_urls`, local and production). The loopback with any
port is there already; a browser Theia's callback address has to be added
there, and reaches production with the next deploy (`supabase config push`).

If the IDE already has a Supabase session for the same project (one login for
the IDE and Yukibana), skip all of this: hand its access token to the client.

## Keeping the session

```ts
import { tokenProvider, YukibanaClient, type SessionStore } from '@yukibana/cli';

const store: SessionStore = {
  load: async () => JSON.parse((await secrets.get('yukibana.session')) ?? 'null'),
  save: async (s) => secrets.set('yukibana.session', JSON.stringify(s)),
  clear: async () => secrets.delete('yukibana.session'),
};
await store.save(session);
const client = new YukibanaClient({ url: registry, accessToken: tokenProvider(store) });
```

The session holds a refresh token: store it where the host keeps secrets
(Theia's or VS Code's secret storage, Electron's `safeStorage` as in
`demo/electron/src/safe-store.ts`), never in plain settings.
`tokenProvider` refreshes an hour-long access token before it expires and
saves the rotated pair; it never runs two refreshes at once, because the
second would find the refresh token spent. When it cannot refresh it throws
`NotLoggedIn`: show the login again.

`accessToken` is just a function returning a token, so any source works.

## The exercise list

```ts
const projects = await client.projects();
```

For a student the registry returns only the projects of editions they are
enrolled in as a student whose window is open now: `availableAfter` has
passed and `closesAt` has not. The database's policies decide that; the IDE
filters nothing and cannot widen it. Each project says:

* `deadline`: when it is due. After it, `late` is true, and a submission
  is still accepted and recorded as late;
* `closesAt`: when it disappears and stops accepting work (null: never);
* `canSubmit`, `starterReady`, `mySubmissions`, `myLastSubmittedAt`.

`client.submissions(projectId)` lists the student's own submissions, newest
first; `latest` marks the one that counts and `late` the ones after the
deadline. Lateness is computed from the server-stamped `submittedAt` against
the deadline as it is now, so an extension granted later applies to work
already handed in. A student still reads their own submissions after a
project closes.

How to word any of this is the host's. The demo's choices, with tests, are
in `demo/electron/src/view.ts`; they are an example, not part of the library.

## The workspace

`client.downloadStarter(projectId)` returns the starter archive;
`readArchive` and `writeEntries` unpack it safely (nothing outside the
target folder, no symlink out of it). The starter carries a `yukibana.json`
with the IDE's settings (`features`, `layout`, `openFiles`, `readOnly`) and
the `projectId`, so the workspace knows where it submits to. `readOnly` is a
list of globs: `matcher(config.readOnly)` from the library answers "is this
path read-only?" with the same rules the assembly uses. Read-only is a
courtesy in the editor; the teacher's assembly is what enforces it, and it
reports every change.

## Submitting: prepare, preview, send

```ts
import { createSubmissionBundle } from '@yukibana/cli';

const made = await createSubmissionBundle(workspaceRoot);
if (!made.ok) return showProblems(made.problems);    // no or broken yukibana.json
const b = made.bundle;
b.files;        // [{ path, type, size, mode }]: exactly what the archive will hold
b.skipped;      // left out: .git, .theia, build output, submission.exclude
b.problems;     // reasons not to send (too large, a symlink out of the folder)
b.read(path);   // the exact bytes that will be sent, for a preview pane
b.projectId;    // from the folder's yukibana.json

if (b.problems.length === 0 && await confirm(`Send ${b.files.length} files?`)) {
  const accepted = await client.submit(b);           // { submissionId, byteSize, sha256 }
}
```

Nothing is compressed until `submit` (or `archive()`), so a preview of a big
folder costs one read of it. The bundle is a snapshot: files saved after it
was made are not in it, so make a new one when the student comes back to
the preview. Packing is the same function `yukibana submit` uses, which is
the point: the IDE and the terminal cannot disagree about what a submission
holds, and the assembly on the teacher's side sees the same files.

Whether to offer the send button is the host's decision from that data: the
demo offers it when there are no problems, the folder names a project, and
that project is open to the student now (`sendable` in its `view.ts`).

## Errors

A refusal is a `RegistryError` with the HTTP `status` and the registry's own
sentence, written to be shown: 401 log in again, 403 not allowed now (the
window has closed, not enrolled), 404 not found or not visible, 413 too
large. `NotLoggedIn` means the session is gone.

## Checklist for the Theia extension

1. A backend contribution that owns a `YukibanaClient`, a `SessionStore` over
   Theia's secret storage, and the bundles; a frontend service interface
   like `demo/electron/src/bridge.ts`.
2. Login: `loginWithLoopback` in Electron Theia; `startLogin` with a backend
   route as the redirect in browser Theia, and that route's address added to
   `supabase/config.toml`.
3. An exercise view over `client.projects()`, a starter download into a new
   workspace, and a submissions view over `client.submissions()`.
4. A submit command: make the bundle, show the file list with a preview of
   any file, show the problems and the late warning, send on confirmation.
5. Apply `yukibana.json`'s `features`, `layout`, `openFiles` and `readOnly`
   when the workspace opens; they are read by the fork, not by the library.
