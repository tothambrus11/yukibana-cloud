/** A login through a browser, coming back to this machine.

 *  desktop IDE. It listens on 127.0.0.1 on a port the system picks, hands
 *  the host the address to open, and waits for the browser to come back to
 *  `/callback`. An IDE served from another machine cannot use this (the
 *  browser's 127.0.0.1 is not the server's) and drives `startLogin` with a
 *  redirect of its own instead.
 *
 *  The library owns nothing a person sees. How the address is opened (the
 *  system browser, a webview, a printed link) and what page the browser
 *  shows when it lands are both the host's: `open` and `callbackPage`.
